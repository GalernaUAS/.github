# Low Budget Plane
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

This project aims to develop a very low budget UAS that complies with all European regulations. It should be adaptable to any generic "Experimental Airlines"/"AerostuffFPV" style airframe.

The electronics MUST BE readily available off-the-shelf components.

For the first serious test, a Raspberry Pi Pio will be used as a flight controller, and the NRF24L01 will be the hardware for the Radio Link. The ground-control hardware and software are TBD...
(But it will most likely be a Linux piece of software and a USB radio module, also based on the Raspberry Pi Pico)
