## Naming
Following the European "tradition" for combat aircraft naming (in spite of the Galerna very clearly **NOT** being a combat aircraft), it has been named after a storm.
A "*Galerna*" or "*Enbata*" is a type of storm that grows and strikes in the Bay of Biscay. A very sudden change in temperature and sea conditions turn an overwhelming sunny day into a much more bearable breezy day for us on land, but it also turns a lovely calm day at sea into a ferocious and very dangerous event.

These storms, in spite of their typical lack of precipitation, receive the utmost respect from everyone along the northern Spanish and south-western French coasts.
